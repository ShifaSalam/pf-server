                                                                   ----------

->It is a non-relational, no sql, document based, open source dbms
->Faster
->Scalable
->document based - JSON documents - data will be stored as key-value pairs
->Schemaless


 MySQL                            MongoDB
------------------------------------------
Database                          DataBase

=>Mongoose-> Its an ODM Library
--------------------------------

-Object Data Modelling library for Mongodb and Node.js
-used to translate objects in node app and representation of those objects in mongodb
-defines schema/structure for storing documents in a collection of mongoDB
       Schema Types(string, number, default,....)
       options(required, default)
-creates model similiar to collection where we can store documents
-to install mongoose:-
        npm i mongoose
-to create collection:
    -create folder in server : DB Folder
    -create a js file to define connection

=>Middleware:

-Special functions that can process requests in between client and server, and block the request if they needed to

const middleware=(req,res,next)=>{
        req
        next()
}

    ->application level middleware
    ->router specific middleware
